people. The writer mentions two main reasons for homelessness: lack of learning among homeless people and the
use of drugs and alcohol. Whilst the writer states that the disease in homeless people is considered the most
important effect of homelessness. As for the problems suffered by homeless persons, the writer determines the

Introduction
Life has a lot of good and bad DوٴDirs. However, people always look
for the better. Нerefore, they like just the nice DوٴDirs that help them to
develop and ensure them a gracious life. On the other hand, there are
bad DوٴDirs which make people unhappy when they see them or even
just when they remember them, so they will feel uncomfortable. As a
result, life will be more diٹcult for them. One of those DوٴDirs is
homelessness. Homelessness exists in all countries and most
communities in the world. Нerefore, it is known that homelessness is
the biggest social problem which the whole world faces in the twent\-
first century. НDt means that homelessness is an international issue
that exists in a lot of societies and every locality people live in and
some people in the world suوٴer from instability due to homelessness.
Natural, homelessness is not a fine phenomenon because unfortunately
it is a proof that there is a defect in the societies that have it.
Apparently, homelessness Dوٴects personal life for homeless people
themselves and others [1-4]. Нerefore, it is very important to find a
solution for this matter. To reach to a solution for any issue or problem,
it needs a comprehensive study on it in all aspects, so as we get
complete information about it. For example, we have to know, the
causes which tend to it, the eوٴects which consequent that issue, the
issues which people suوٴer from them and the people themselves who
suوٴer from it. Нen, we will be able to choose the right solution for that
phenomenon or issue. Нis applies to homeless people who we see
every day. Нere are many causes and eوٴects for homelessness. Also,
homeless people have their own issues [5].
Literature Review
НH causes of homeless people
Education is the most important requirement for everybody to get a
fit job ensuring a dignified life. Otherwise, the existence will be
complicated for him or her. Without education, the homeless people,
especially children, will not have the opportunity to acquire important
life skills [6]. Researches show that nearly to three-quarters of
homeless youth give up going to school [7]. However, one of the main
reasons of homelessness is lack of education or training for homeless
people themselves. Homeless people face trammels which make them
not attend schools or attend them intermittently. Homeless people are
very poor, so they cannot Dوٴord the costs for their studies. Нe\ just
look for the life even that they barely find food for themselves. Also,
transportation is one of the barriers. Homeless families live in place
away from the schools and they are unstable in specific shelters. Нis is
because; searching for a safer and cheaper shelter is easier not in the
city center. For example, the rent prices of accommodation in the
farms are cheaper than the other parts of the city, so homeless people
have to live there away from schools. In addition, the tuition in
universities is of education or training barriers for many people and
homeless people precisely. According to Desjardins [8], surveying
about barriers to training in 2008, there were 38% approximately of
Canadians saying that training is too expensive, and they could not
Dوٴord the cost. Нis percentage is high for people who are not
homeless. So, absolutely, percentage of homeless people is higher,
because they are poorer that the others. Also, this statistic is in Canada
which is of the richest countries that means that percentage is higher in
other society. In addition, the bad health for homeless people hinders
them to go to schools. Нere are some of them who cannot walk on
their feet, so they face a diٹcult\ to go to their schools. Some of them
are blind and alone that means it is impossible that they go to take
classes by themselves. As everyone knows that encouragement is
extremely crucial for everyone. Homeless people are losing
encouragement to learn or at least develop themselves. Most of them
live alone, so they do not have friends or anybody who encourages
them. Consequently, they have the same feeling when they are
studying or training or not. Нis means that they are unexcited to do
anything even if it is tremendously paramount for them [9].
Of the other causes for homelessness is addiction, where the vast
majority of homeless people use drugs and alcohol. Studies have found
repeatedly that drug use is more prevalent among homeless people
than others [10-14]. Rouse indicates in statistics conducted in Boston
city that 91 percent of homeless people use alcohol, and 88 percent of
them use diوٴerent kinds of drugs [5]. Нis means that 9 percent only of
homeless people use neither drugs nor alcohol, 2 percent of them use

either drugs or alcohol, and 88 percent of them use both drugs and
alcohol. Нese percentages are high extremely. So, we conclude from
previous statistic that there is a close relationship between using drugs
or alcohol and homelessness. Among the most vulnerable and
underprivileged groups in society are the homeless people who
suوٴering from drugs, alcohol and mental disorders [15,16]. Naturally,
there are reasons which made homeless people fell in this scourge
which is indication. One of these motives is that they live in a bad
psychological condition. Homeless people face poverty and hunger
even that some of them do not have food. Нerefore, they look for
anything that makes them forget about their living situation which
they suوٴer from. So, they suppose that drinking helps them to be glad
and forget about their responsibilities towards themselves even if that
is for a short period of time. In addition, it is easy for people who use
drugs, alcohol or both to be homeless. Нis means addiction leads to
homelessness in many times, where those abusers are ready to give up
everything for the sake of getting drugs. For example, it is possible for
addicted people to sale their houses, cars or anything which has a value
for them to get money and buy drugs. Нis is because they need to take
drugs by any way. As a result, homelessness may tend to addiction and
addiction could tend to homelessness. As you know that addiction
make addicted people unconscious to what is happening around them
[17]. Subsequently, no one with a vacant job with accept them to work
as long as they are addicted.
НH HوٴHFts of homeless people
However, there are many eوٴects of homelessness. Нe diseases are of
main for these eوٴects of homeless people. Most of them have health
problems. Some of diseases which they have are intractable or
permanent such as cancer. In addition, they are vulnerable to
dangerous diseases such as hepatitis and sexually transmitted
infections [11]. Also, some of them are non-chronic. Нe\ suوٴer from
diseases because of several reasons. One of these reasons is that
homeless have diٹcult\ accessing hospitals and health services
(Hospital discharge of homeless people, 2012). Other reason is that
they do not care about their personal hygiene. Where that, some of
them are not taking a shower for a long period of time, maybe it
reaches to consecutive three months. But, what about the reasons
which made them do not bathe? Нere are many reasons; one of them
is that they do not have houses that mean there is no place to take a
shower for them. In addition, lack of awareness is one of core reasons.
Where that there is no one tells them that ablution is very significDnt
for their health. So, most of them do not have knowledge about the
importance ablution for their health. Нis is because the majority of
them do not have families and friends which mean they do not have
anyone help to know the health ailments which maybe happened
because of lack of ablution. Also, most of governments in the world do
not contact with them and show them the risk of not washing. In
addition, homeless youth suوٴer from psychological symptoms such as
depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders at high rates [18-20].
One of them is violence. Violence is most of dangerous crime for all
people, because often, it leads to death. Нere are many people in the
world who suوٴer from violence and a lot of people classify the
homeless as sources of violence in the societies. Many homeless people
commit crimes such as theft, murder and kidnapping. If we look at the
crimes that happened, we find that most of these are committed by
homeless people. Last year’s victims, a man called Mark /ufkin, 39,
died in April last year Dfter he was attacked at a homeless shelter in
Concord. Also, there are a lot of victims due to homeless people. Нe\
are influentiDl because of several reasons. One of these reasons is that
some homeless people were influenced in the past when they were
children from their families if they had ones or from any other people.
As we know influence generates more influence. Нerefore, they
commit crimes, as a reaction for the action which happened for them
in the past. In addition, the majority of homeless people do not have
families and they lost anything in the life, so they feel that their life is
empty. Нerefore, they do not care about anything they do that means
it is possible for them to kill or steal to the extent that they may
commit suicide. Also, some people look to homeless people oوٴensive
look. Some of them look at homeless contempt look and disrespect
them. For example, when a homeless person stays around a street and
says hello to someone walks around him or her, the other person
ignores him or her deliberately. Нis makes a kind of hostility toward
the other person; so maybe, it develops to reach the valiance. Нis
makes homeless feel there is more animus toward homeless people
from some people. Нis makes homeless have a cruel reaction toward
the societies [21]. In addition, diseases are of main eوٴects for homeless
people. Most of them have health problems. Some of diseases which
they have are intractable or permanent such as cancer. Some of them
are non-chronic. Нe\ suوٴer from diseases because of several reasons.
One of these reasons is that they do not care about their personal
hygiene. Where that, some of them are not taking a shower for a long
period of time, maybe it reaches to consecutive three months. But,
what about the reasons which made them do not bathe? Нere are
many reasons; one of them is that they do not have houses that mean
there is no place to take a shower for them. In addition, lack of
awareness is one of core reasons. Where that there is no one tells them
that ablution is very significDnt for their health. So, most of them do
not have knowledge about the importance ablution for their health.
Нis is because the majority of them do not have families and friends
which mean they do not have anyone help to know the health ailments
which maybe happened because of lack of ablution. Also, most of
governments in the world do not contact with them and show them
the risk of not washing.
Poor nutrition is one of disease causes. Homeless people usually do
not eat for a long time. Also, when they eat, they eat leftovers. For
example, as we see them often, they collect their food from the trash
which means they feed on unhealthy food. Consequently, it is normal
that they will have healthy problems. On the other hand, most the
hospitals in the world are not free and are not cheap. So, homeless
people face diٹculties to treat themselves. As we know that homeless
people do not have money to have food which means they do not have
the finDnciDl capacity to pay to the hospital in order to manage to be
treated.
НH issues of homeless people
Homeless people have a lot of issues which they have to deal with.
Poverty is one of these issues. Homeless people have a lot of issues
which they should deal with. Poverty is one of these issues. Нe\ do not
have the money which ensures to them accommodation and food.
Where that most of them do not have jobs and they find it diٹcult to
get jobs. Нis goes back to that they are non-eligible to get jobs which
means there are no sources of income for them.
Most institutions and companies do not accept them because of lack
of education. Also, some homeless people do have the motivation for
work. As mentioned previously, poverty is the core cause for homeless
people. “Homelessness is rooted hard and deep in poverty. Homeless
are poor people they come overwhelmingly from poor families” [22].
So, according to Liebow [22] it shows us that poverty is the only major

problem for homelessness. Нis issue is very important, so it necessary
to solve it. Нere are many solutions for this issue. One of them is
supporting charities. Нe charities are the nearest to homeless people
for ease their suوٴering.
In America, according to the statistic from the Nation Indicate that
the number of people who are living in extreme poverty (less than
$11,510 for a family of four) is 20.4 million, 1 in 15 Americans,
including more than 15 million women and children [23]. Нe\ do not
have the money which ensures to them accommodation and food.
Where that most of them do not have jobs and they find it diٹcult to
get jobs. Нis goes back to that they are non-eligible to get jobs which
means there are no sources of income for them. Most institutions and
companies do not accept them because of lack of education. Also,
some homeless people do have the motivation for work. As mentioned
previously, poverty is the core cause for homeless people. 5oleوٴ says
that “homelessness is rooted hard and deep in poverty. Homeless are
poor people and they come overwhelming from poor families”. So,
according to what 5oleوٴ says, it shows us that poverty is the only
major problem for homelessness. Нis issue is very important, so it is
necessary to solve it. Нere are many solutions for this issue. One of
them is supporting charities. Нe charities are the nearest to homeless
people to ease their suوٴering. Where that supporting charities will
improve homeless people’s living for the better. As soon as the
charitable organizations receive funds from government or other
people, the situation of homeless people will rise for the better. For
example, when we donate to the charitable organizations, they will
spend our donation to build houses for homeless people. Also,
facilitating the access to education is of best solution for homelessness.
Нrough, grant scholarships to continue their education or make the
education free for low income. Where that education is makes
homeless people eligible to get jobs. Нen, they will be able to depend
on themselves.
In addition, loneliness considered from the issues which homeless
people suوٴer. Нe feelings of loneliness experienced by the homeless
can have very detrimental eوٴects both on their spiritual, physical and
emotional health. Loneliness has been linked to such maladies as
anxiety, hostility, depression, poor self-concept, alcoholism, and
psychosomatic illnesses [24]. All of these reactions due to loneliness,
therefore, it must be solved. Нis problem will be resolved by finding
organizations to take care of homeless people and to be a meeting
place. So, they will get to know each other, and then they will not feel
lonely. Also, there is a method for many homeless people to overcome
feelings of intense loneliness is to acquire pets as Kennedy says.
Discussion and Conclusion
In conclusion, this phenomenon is like most social phenomena, but
it is sensitive to all social levels to the community. Нus, it requires
many of the concerted eوٴorts of both researchers meetings and
economists, in addition to the eوٴorts of civil society. Homelessness is a
serious problem and phenomenon in the same time that impacts
thousands of people each year in many countries. It is a problem that
also the governments and societies are committed to tackling more
eوٴectivel\ each year. Нere should be more homeless refuges and
faculties for those in need, as homeless people are humans just like the
rest of us. People should definitel\ sympathize to homeless people,
because with the right charities, institution, support and help,
homelessness could be overcome, and homeless people will be able to
make a change in their lives. Нere are plenty of ways to improve the
fate of homeless people and homelessness needs a lot of work to be
solved. It is not so easily solved as some might expect. But, also it is not
impossible. Нerefore, it is important not to underestimate their status
or make it a regular sight, and to ensure that access to it must be
recruiting international community, which can and must decide how
to treat their status.
